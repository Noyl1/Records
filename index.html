Sittin' in the car, listening to Blonde
Fallin' for each other
Pink and orange skies, feelin' super childish
No Donald Glover
Missed call from my mother
Like, Where you at tonight? Got no alibi
I was all alone with the love of my life
Shes got glitter for skin
My radiant beam in the night
I dont need no light to see you
Shine
Its your golden hour (oh)
You slow down time
In your golden hour (oh)
We were just two lovers
Feet up on the dash, drivin' nowhere fast
Burnin' through the summer
Radio on blast, make the moment last
She got solar power
Minutes feel like hours
She knew she was the baddest, can you even imagine
Fallin like I did?
For the love of my life
Shes got glow on her face
A glorious look in her eyes
My angel of light
I was all alone with the love of my life
Shes got glitter for skin
My radiant beam in the night
I dont need no light to see you
Shine
Its your golden hour (oh)
You slow down time

When everything feels like the movies
Yeah, you bleed just to know youre alive

Shes the giggle at a funeral
Knows everybody disapproval
I shouldve worshipped her sooner

If the heavens ever did speak
Shes the last true mouthpiece
Every Sundays getting more bleak
A fresh poison each week

We were born sick, you heard them say it

My church offers no absolutes
She tells me, Worship in the bedroom
The only heaven Ill be sent to
Is when Im alone with you

I was born sick
But I love it
Command me to be well
Aaay. Amen. Amen. Amen

Take me to church
Ill worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
Ill tell you my sins so you can sharpen your knife
Offer me that deathless death
Good God, let me give you my life
Take me to church
Ill worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
Ill tell you my sins so you can sharpen your knife
Offer me that deathless death
Good God, let me give you my life

If Im a pagan of the good times
My lovers the sunlight
To keep the Goddess on my side
She demands a sacrifice

Drain the whole sea
Get something shiny
Something meaty for the main course
Thats a fine-looking high horse
What you got in the stable?
Weve a lot of starving faithful

That looks tasty
That looks plenty
This is hungry work

Take me to church
Ill worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
Ill tell you my sins so you can sharpen your knife
Offer me my deathless death

Mixin' codeine up with the phenergan
She got thick, but she wanna get thin again
Drinkin' apple cider vinegar
Wearin' Skim 'cause she wanna be Kim and 'em
Uh, alright
I know that you're bad, stop actin' innocent
We ain't got generational wealth
It's only a year that I've had these millions
My whip could've been in the Tokyo Drift 'cause it's fast and furious
I went from the Toyota Yaris to Urus, they had their chance, but blew it
Now this gyal wan' me in her uterus, fuck it, I'm rich, let's do it (fuck it)
Take a look at these diamonds wrong, it's a life of squintin', can't just stare
With bae through thick and thin
She already thick, so I'm halfway there (hahaha)
Brown and bad, couldn't change my mind, I was halfway there
One hundred meters, huh
I just put nine gyal in a Sprinter (uh)
One hundred eaters, they won't fit in one SUV, nah
S-O-S, somebody rescue me
I got too many gyal, too many-many gyal, I got
They can last me the next two weeks, uh
Huh, alright, like send the address through, please
SUV, the outside white
The inside brown like Michael Jack'
More time, man build a line and trap
Spend like I don't even like my stack
Pistol came on a Irish ferry, let go and it sound like a tap dance (bap)
The way that I ball, no yellow
The ref haffa give me a black card
Who did what we doin' with rap?
Man couldn't sell out his show after all them years of doin' the cap
Sprinter, two gyal in a van
Inter, two man in Milan, heard one of my tings datin' P. Diddy
Need 20 percent of whatever she bags
Outside, my head in my hands
I told her my name is Cench, she said, No, the one on your birth certificate,  uh
Your boyfriend ran from the diamond test 'cause they weren't legitimate, nah
She Turkish-Cypriot, but her curves Brazilian, uh
I want her, and bro wants her affiliate
I'm cheap, still hit a chick like, Yo, can I borrow your Netflix?
She a feminist, she think I'm sexist
Twistin' my words, I think she dyslexic
Give me my space, I'm intergalactic
Before I give you my Insta' password, I'll give you the pin to my AmEx, huh, alright
This ain't stainless steel, it's platinum
Dinner table, I got manners, huh
T-shirt tucked in, napkin
Still loading,  that's the caption, I've only amounted a minimal fraction
Eat good, I got indigestion
Bare snow in my hood, no Aspen, can't get rid of my pain with Aspirin
Dave just came in an Aston, I'm makin' that Maybach music (M-Maybach Music)
They're tryna insult my intelligence, sometimes, I may act stupid
I never went uni, I been on the campus sellin' cocaine to students
If bro let the drumstick beat, then somethin' gon' leak
We ain't playin' exclusives
Take a look at these diamonds wrong, it's a life of squintin', can't just stare

Huh, alright, like send the address through, please
Fire for a wife beater, can't rock with that, I ain't wearin' a vest
Man have to send her therapy, she got the E-cup bra, a lot on her chest
I'm in Jamaica, Oracabess'
Hit a lick, went cash converters
That don't work, it's pawn, no chess
I'm doin' more and talkin' less
I love chillin' with broke bitches, man book one flight, and they're all impressed (alright)
I'm in the G63, the car hug me like a friend through twist and turns
Man livin' for nyash and dyin' for nyash
It's fucked, don't know which one's worse, I'm fucked
Bags in his and hers, what's hers is hers, what's mine is too
Heard that girl is a gold digger, it can't be true if she dated you
AP baby blue, paper's pink, I'd probably hate me too
You ever spent six figures and stared at bae like, Look what you made me do?
Yeah, alright, started with a Q, didn't wait in line
Weird, I'm askin' my Blasian one, Why you so focused on your Asian side?
I know that the jack boys pray that they get to the clubs and Dave's inside">
